# Light Mixing Game

I made this because I wanted to learn about mixing light (as opposed to mixing paint)

## ToDo

- [] Make it so drag and drop works on mobile...

- [] Change from arbitrary assignment for tertiary 'addition' to proper maths.

- [] Change tertiary mechanics so the first colour in a square is 50% strength.

- [] Make high scores in local storage?

- [] Add a bit more white space.

- [x] Make it so there are the right number of colours available and they are randomly distributed.

- [x] Make it drag and drop instead of click.

- [x] Change from squares to circles and add 'glow'

- [x] Make background dark

- [x] Make it so secondary/tertiary is a game setting rather than a game mechanic

- [x] Make list colours darker in tertiary mode
