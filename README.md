# Light Mixing Game

I made this because I wanted to learn about mixing light (as opposed to mixing paint)

## ToDo

- [] Change from squares to circles and add 'glow'

- [] Make background dark

- [] Change from arbitrary assignment for tertiary 'addition' to proper maths.

- [x] Make it so secondary/tertiary is a game setting rather than a game mechanic

- [] Make high scores in local storage?

- [] Make list colours darker in tertiary mode
